# Intro to AI Assignments

## Deep Learning
Created an artificial neural network (ANN) based classifier to classify the health status of citrus fruits and leaves using a large dataset.
https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/citrus_leaves.

Used TensorFlow and Keras libraries to work on transfer learning in the context of convolution neural nets (CNN). Used a pre-trained network (MobileNetV2) to do image 
classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## NLP
Generated and analysed word embeddings using the Word2Vec algorithm on a corpus of COVID-19 related tweets. 
The goal was to understand the semantics captured by embeddings through preprocessing techniques and hyperparameter tuning.

## Reinforcement Learning
Gained experience with OpenAI Gym and how to implement Q-learning.
